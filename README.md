# An Introduction to Real World CS

##Motivation

Students that go into college CS courses often go in with the hope that they’ll be able to come out being able to build something like a website or an application of their own thought and design. However most CS Courses focus on the fundamentals in order to prepare them for the long track of university teaching ahead. In universities such as Berkeley that have a cut-off for their computer science major, this inadvertently discourages a lot of students as they don’t get what they thought they were going to get. Thus, this course aims to provide a step off of the fundamentals into the world of what computer science often ends up being about: turning ideas into a reality.

##Goals

There are two ultimate goals for this course; one that is explicit in the overall structure and assignments, and one that is implicit in the way ideas are presented.

By the end of this course, the hope is that students will feel comfortable with creating a mobile application (or python script or web application) to accomplish some personal goal or idea they have in mind. It does not aim to provide a comprehensive knowledge of app development or the like, but rather an insight into what kinds of questions to ask in order to get closer to your goal. Computer Science is not about knowing, it’s about tinkering and asking questions. This course aims to formalize that process into a structured learning experience letting a significant portion of the learning happen outside of a how-to style reading/video.

The implicit goal of this course is to inspire students to be interested in the technical fundamentals and theory as well as push them in the direction of becoming talented engineers. Computer Science is about tinkering, as mentioned earlier; however as you tinker, it’s important to integrate new knowledge intelligently and strive for sustainable coding practices that will not fail you as you grow as a programmer. The goal is to teach you how to be a good learner aka a good teacher for yourself.

A minor goal that will hopefully play a bigger role in future iterations of the course is UI/UX design, however for now it will remain a side-note.

##Syllabus

_TODO: Formalize Requirements for Design Projects_

This course will have the overall narrative of having the students building the product that they want to build. At the start, they will decide on something that they would like to build. A diverse array of ideas will be provided, but the student is welcome to choose whatever they’d like as long as it fits a certain set of requirements. Those requirements will also found the basis for what will actually be taught in this course. Along the way, students will be encouraged to stray from the path, and ask their own questions to Google or peers to figure out how to add more features that aren't directly covered in the class.  

Additionally, for the content that will be covered, there will be an emphasis on learning and understanding the basics quickly in order to spend more time experimenting and trying to get things to work. This class will also (ideally) be *discussion based* where there will be outlets to ask questions to your peers as you try and figure out tasks together. The point is to teach content by focusing on teaching you how to teach yourself, using the targeted content as the context.
